<FONT size="3"><p><font size="5" face="Georgia, Arial" color="yellow">M</font>assive star forming regions (MSFRs) constitute ``mini starbursts''. The winds from OB stars (and consequently the supernovae) affect the natal cloud and ISM by both returning
processed materials and kinematically creating cavities, therefore
contributing to the evolution of our galaxy. The formation of new generations of
low mass stars is triggered by the presence of massive
stars. However, MSFRs are typically located at large distances
(>1 kpc), where traditional optical and IR studies suffer
from extinction, bright nebulosity, and heavy contamination from field stars. Chandra
X-ray Observatory opens a new window to study MSFRs by offering
superior spatial resolution, sensitivity, and a broad bandpass
while simultaneously providing coordinates, lightcurves, and
spectra of hundreds of young stars in each MSFR. The Chandra
images routinely penetrates Av>100 mag of extinction, with
little confusion or contamination from old foreground and
background stars, revealing the young stellar populations even
when they are embedded.</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Georgia, Arial" color="yellow">T</font>he focus of my current research is studying the X-ray emitting young stellar populations in the Galactic MSFRs with Chandra observations. I am actively working with the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer (ACIS) team, analyzing ACIS observations of MSFRs,
characterizing individual X-ray point sources and the population, and
examining the optical/IR properties of a large number of previously
uncataloged young stars in these regions for further follow-up.</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Georgia, Arial" color="yellow">I</font> have led a Chandra study of the massive star forming complex
NGC 6357 and the young open cluster Pismis 24 (Wang et al. 2007a). 
In the ongoing study of the Rosette star-forming complex (Wang et al.2007b,2007c), we have
obtained X-ray image mosaic covering the ionizing cluster, the
interface between the photoionized gas and the cold neutral
material, and small embedded clusters in the dense molecular
cloud.</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Georgia, Arial" color="yellow">F</font>ollowing the discovery of a large sample of X-ray-selected young stars, I will change gears to characterize their circumstellar disks in infrared (IR) with the Spitzer Space Telescope in late 2007. The primary goal is to quantify how the wind and radiation dominated environment around the massive stars affects the disk properties of the lower mass stars.

<h2><li type="square">Dust Extinction Properties</li></h2>
<FONT size="3"><p><font size="5" face="Georgia, Arial" color="yellow">I</font> am fascinated by the cosmic dust that seems to be everywhere in the universe -- from protoplanetary disks to high redshift AGNs. In collaboration with Prof. Pat Hall (Princeton Univ.) and Prof. Aigen Li (Univ. of Missouri), we (Wang, Hall, Ge, Li, & Schneider 2004, ApJ) carried out a systematic search for 2175A dust feature in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We reported identifications of this dust absorption feature in three galaxies at 1.4< z <1.5 that produce intervening Mg
II absorption toward quasars. The observed reddened spectra
can be fit using quasar composite spectrum with Galactic-type extinction laws. Our discoveries imply
that the dust in these distant quasar absorption systems is similar in
composition to that of the Milky Way, but with a range of different
grain size distributions.</p></FONT>
